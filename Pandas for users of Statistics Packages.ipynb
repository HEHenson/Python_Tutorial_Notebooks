    "Analysts will typically use a proprietary statistical package to manage and analyze data relevant to their field.  Typically, this data will come from many different sources, both in-house and external.  This note examines the management of data through Python Pandas.  A subsequent note will look at other Python packages for the analysis of the data that has been stored in Pandas.  Pandas and these packages used together can provide a technically superior replacement to the traditional software packages provided there is a willingness to make the initial investment in learning an actual programing language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full power of Pandas can only be appreciated by examining it from many dimensions.  This tutorial demonstrates some of the capacity of Pandas to provide the data management features that many applied statistical analysts have become accustomed. It is centered around the construction of a contrived and synthethic database of just six time series.  The data is manipulated into a three dimensional matrix that can be exported to statsmodels for statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The note will progress through several phases to achieve this end.  First it will show how Pandas supports a time series variable that is similar to what would be found in a macroeconomic package.  Then several of these time series variables are combined in to a two dimensional database that is very similar to those provided by many statistical packages.  Next, another dimension is added to create what could be called a panel database. Finally, this data is easily exported to a three dimensional array that can be used by statsmodels for advanced statistical analysis. "

This is not found in most programming langauges but the Pandas library allows users to create objects that can behave in a fashion similar to a time series variable in a macro economic package. The only difference is that the Pandas user has far more flexibility to create many different styles of these variables.  Thus the creation of a single time series involves more decisions with pandas than with a standard econometric package.  This is the inevitable cost of the greater freedom."

For example a single survey may be seen as a two dimensional matrix of responses and individuals in the sample.  If the survey is repeated then the two surveys combined becomes a panel dataset. This is valid but Pandas does not restrict one to this way of thinking about a panel.\n",
